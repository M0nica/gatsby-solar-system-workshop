# 06 â€¢ Add Links to Card Component

## Background ðŸ“š
Our site's Button component uses the [Gatsby Link](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-link/) component under the hood. Gatsby uses the `<Link>` component to improve the loading time of internal pages by being able to preload additional pages in the background as a user navigates closer to the link. It is preferable for internal links to use `<Link>` instead of a traditional anchor tag.

## Exercise ðŸ¤“
- Update the `button` in `planetCard` to go `to` the actual planet pages instead of `#`. The value passed to `to` shouldbe the same one that `href` would be use for a traditional link.
